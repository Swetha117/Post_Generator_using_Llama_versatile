DSA makes or breaks your application.\n Senior Level roles? DSA is still your entry ticket to more advanced rounds.\n\nSo here’s what I did differently after these rejections \n\n I stopped ‘solving’ DSA problems on LeetCode and started breaking them down into patterns I could reuse.\n I revised core CS subjects (OS, CN, DBMS, OOP) with the same seriousness as DSA.\n I began doing mock interviews with senior SDEs and peers, because they can spot your blind spots better than you can yourself.\n\nIf you’re aiming for a job switch while juggling a full-time job, your prep approach being structured can save you from making the same mistakes.\n\nThat’s exactly why I recommend Bosscoder Academy.\n\n Explore their programs here: https://bit.ly/45OwjsT \n\nThey’ve helped 2200+ engineers crack top PBC roles through:\n\n Structured prep in DSA, System Design & Full Stack\n 1:1 mentorship from industry pros\n Resume reviews, mock interviews, and 100% job switch support\n Real project exposure & 24/7 doubt-solving\n\n P.S.: Their Independence Day Sale is live. 25% OFF on all courses right now.

  "text": "I lost an offer from D.E. Shaw because of ONE binary tree question…\n\nYep, just one DSA follow-up, and it cost me a 30+ LPA opportunity. 😔\n\nHere’s my full interview experience at D.E. Shaw so you know what to prepare for 👇\n\n💠 Round 1: Online Assessment (90 mins)\n\n→ 1 DP question [medium-hard]\n→ 1 array-based problem [easy-medium]\n→ 60 MCQs across core CS fundamentals and debugging\n\n💠 Round 2: CodePair Round (Interview)\n\n→ 0-1 Knapsack variant (solved ✅)\n→ Binary Tree + tricky follow-up (fumbled here ❌)\n→ 1 logical puzzle\n\nI had a strong first round and was doing fairly well in the second, until the binary tree question turned into a follow-up I hadn’t anticipated.\n\nAnd that one gap in handling edge cases ended my run.\n\nHere’s what I learned → \n\nIn interviews with top PBCs, it’s not just about solving the question. It’s about handling follow-ups, edge cases, and communicating clearly. You can get 80% of the logic right and still not clear the round.\n\nAnd this rejection pushed me to go deeper into DSA, not just solving, but building pattern recognition, optimizing my approach, and improving how I explain.\n\nIf you’re also aiming for top-tier companies and juggling prep with a 9–5, structured guidance can save you months.\n\nThat’s why I recommend Bosscoder Academy.\n\n🔗 Explore their programs here: https://bit.ly/4oe6H0G \n\nThey’ve helped 2200+ engineers crack top PBC roles through:\n\n💡 Structured prep in DSA, System Design & Full Stack\n💡 1:1 mentorship from industry pros\n💡 Resume reviews, mock interviews, and 100% job switch support\n💡 Real project exposure & 24/7 doubt-solving\n\n📢 P.S.: Their Independence Day Sale is live. 25% OFF on all courses right now.

Here’s how:\n\n🔁 I stick to one topic at a time and solve 20+ problems in a row to build depth.\n📚 I give each problem 30 minutes before checking the solution.\n🧠 I write down patterns and key takeaways to actually understand, not just memorize.\n\nAnd, I understand not everyone has that much time or guidance, so I've been testing this free AI LeetCode Mentor extension, Leeco AI, to practice → https://lnkd.in/gpNxGPKG\n\nWhat I love about it:\n✅ Live feedback: helps you fix logic gaps while solving, not after wasting 30 minutes\n✅ Instant explanations: just highlight and get clarity without breaking focus\n✅ Interview mode: practice with timers + get feedback like a real interview\n✅ Works everywhere: not just limited to LeetCode\n\nWith this, you spend less time figuring things out and more time making progress.\n→ Download and try this free extension: https://lnkd.in/gpNxGPKG\n\nIf you’re stuck like I was, this can actually help.

  "text": "In my early days, I got rejected by every single company I applied to 😞💔\nAll because of this one simple mistake:\n\n🔴 Jumping straight into code.\nI’d miss edge cases, pick the wrong approach…\nHere’s the framework that finally helped me crack coding interviews:\n\n📌 Minute 1-2: Clarify the problem\nAsk for edge cases, input/output expectations, constraints.\n📌 Minute 3-5: Walk through examples\nPick a small input and dry-run it. Think out loud. Build trust.\n📌 Minute 6-8: Talk brute force\nEven if it’s not optimal, start somewhere. Thinking matters more than the final answer.\n📌 Minute 9-10: Ask: “Can I start coding?”\nLet the interviewer know your plan. Be collaborative, not silent.\n\nNow, just knowing this framework isn’t enough. You need to practice it regularly to structure your thoughts and stay calm during the follow-ups. Mock interviews helped me develop that skill. ✔️\n\nYou can do the same by connecting 1:1 with senior developers from big techs and preparing with them.\n→ You can connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/gpG8HdeR\n\nThese experts on hiring panels will ensure you can think, code, and explain within 45 minutes. They’ll provide instant feedback on your problem-solving approach, helping you refine your strategy before the actual interview.\n\nThey also help with overall interview prep including upskilling, resume review, referrals and more.
